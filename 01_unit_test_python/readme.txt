Goal: Unit test the contractor class (~1h)

1) Make sure you have python installed (> v3)
2) Make sure you are able to run the UT (Ex: "python3 -m unittest test_contractor.py"). The file has one passing test already as example
3) Test all functions of contractor class
4) Create a function on contractor class that calculate and return his total commission earned based on the fields "percentage_service_fee_rate" and "total_amount_of_money_earned"
5) Add a test to this function
